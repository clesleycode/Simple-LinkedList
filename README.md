# Simple-LinkedList
COMS 3137 Assignment 2

Assume a simple Linked List data structure such as the one below (NOT a Java
Collections API Linked List). Write brief Java methods to do the following:

  (a) return the size of the linked list
  
  (b) print the linked list
  
  (c) test if a value x is contained in the linked list
  
  (d) add a value x if it is not already in the linked list (add at the end of the list)
  
  (e) remove a value x if it is contained in the list
  
  (f) reverse the order of the items in the linked list
  
  (g) Given two lists, Li and L2, create a new list L3 that contains the interesection (common
  data elements) of L1 and L2.
